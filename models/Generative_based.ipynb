       "[('My wife and mother are having tense disagreements  In the past  they ve had minor differences  For example  my wife would complain to me my mother is too overbearing  my mother would complain my wife is lazy   However  it s intensified lately  I think the cause is my wife talked back to her once  Now  any little disagreement is magnified  leading to major disagreements  What can I do ',\n",
       "  'What you are describing is something psychologists have termed  triangulation  which is what happens when one family member will not talk to the one they have a problem with and goes to a third member of the family to complain instead  You have been  triangulated  by your wife and mother This is often seen in families  It s seen everywhere  How many times have you had a problem with someone but you didn t go to them to tell them you went to someone else to complain  It is usually difficult for a person to confront another especially in relationships where there is a power differential  For example I bet it s easier to complain to a coworker about your boss rather than go to the boss with your complaint I m not saying triangulation is always a bad thing  Sometimes a third party mediator is needed to help solve problems between two people who disagree  That s what therapists do every day  Sometimes just getting someone else s perspective can help you see the issue clearer  However in your situation it sounds like this is becoming a problem  You are stuck in the middle between two people that love you and that you love If you want to put a stop to this triangulation you will need to encourage the two of them to talk to each other and work out their differences  Perhaps it was a simple misunderstanding that some open communication can clear up  Even if they really don t like each other and can t get along your relationship with the both of them is going to continue to deteriorate the longer you are stuck in the middle  Try to understand what might be the feelings behind their behavior  It is possible that they may both feel threatened by the other  These are the two most important women in your life and they both know it  Your mother may be afraid that she will lose you if she confronts your wife  I heard one motherinlaw describe her son s wife as the gateway to her son  The wife has the power to dictate when and how often the mother gets to see her son  The wife also is the gateway to the grandchildren  If your wife doesn t like her motherinlaw she can severely hamper or damage her motherinlaw s relationship with you and any children you two may have  From your wife s viewpoint this is the woman that she may feel like she can never live up to  If you regularly praise your mom s cooking her housework gardening or anything else your wife may feel that you are putting down her own efforts in these areas and can feel unappreciated  This can be especially difficult if your wife and mother are nothing alike  I am not saying that this is the case with your family s situation  These are just a few examples from other families in a similar situation as yours  Regardless of what the cause is if this dysfunctional pattern is allowed to continue your mom and your wife will begin to get upset with you when you don t agree with them  They will get upset if you don t align yourself with them against the other  They will be offended when it seems like you are choosing the other one s side or that you are not standing up for them like they think you should  In worst cases if it continues to escalate you may even find yourself in the impossible position of having to choose between your wife and your mother which may mean cutting off contact with the other ending that relationship  Change the dynamics before it spirals even further '),\n",
       " ('I m planning to have baby  so I have to quit smoking   but it s hard  Sometimes it s not a physical need  it s mental     I cannot help myself from thinking about smoking  What can I do to get rid of this addiction ',\n",
       "  'Hi  Good for you in planning ahead to do what s healthiest for your baby and yourself  That s a great first step  It s also good that you are able to identify that it s not always a physical need that s driving the addiction For the next steps I would suggest trying to figure out when the psychological cravings for a cigarette occur  The psychological or mental cravings are usually based out of habit such as having a cigarette after a meal  And if you re consciously trying to quit you ll find the craving starts with simply thinking about having a cigarette then usually moves on to thinking about how good it made you feel etc  etc  Well if I m on a diet and I continue to let myself think about the ice cream sitting in the freezer eventually I ll give in and eat it You re going to have thoughts about smoking a cigarette  That s normal and for the most part out of your control  But you choose whether or not to CONTINUE thinking and dwelling about it after that initial thought  That s what you would have to work on changing  When you have that initial thought acknowledge it  Ok I kind of want a cigarette now   but then change the thoughts that typically follow  Distract yourself think about something else do something else whatever it takes to get your mind off of that cigarette I ve suggested to clients before that they should plan these scenarios out ahead of time so they already know what they re going to do when the time comes  Write down when you usually have the craving for a cigarette and then write down new thoughts or things to do to get your mind off of it  Eventually it will become easier and easier to brush off that initial thought until you no longer have it Best of luck and you have a really great motivator to quit  your baby '),\n",

       "  'It sounds like keeping the secrets has become a problem for you now  There are several things to consider before you make a decision  You mentioned that you don t want your wife and mom to know because you don t want to hurt them   why would it hurt them   Is it necessary for them to know this information  What are the consequences of either telling them the truth or not telling them  for you and for your wife and mom  Once you have considered these think of what you would tell your friend if they were in your exact situation  Also if your wife or mom were in your situation right now what do you think they would do themselves  If your wife and mom were in this situation how would you feel  Would you want to know the secrets  How has keeping these secrets affected your own mental and physical health Once you have looked at the problem from all angles you will be able to better make a decision on whether it is right to tell them or not '),\n",

       "  'Hi there  It s great you are able to realize there are other issues going on with someone who feels possessive  At the root of it is fear  Fear of losing someone fear of being alone fear of not being good enough  All those fears can lead to low selfesteem and feeling like you have to control other people so you don t lose them  The thing is controlling other people only pushes them away  Vicious circle right  What I would suggest is some cognitive therapy to change those underlying ways of thinking  You can start with this assignment  Write down all the things you think about yourself positive and notsopositive  Then rewrite those notsopositive things so they are positive  For example thinking something like  I m too pushy  can be rewritten as  I m assertive and I go after what I want   It can be hard to do since we tend to get  stuck  in our negative ways of thinking about ourselves  If you have someone you trust you can ask for their help as well since most likely they see you differently than you see yourself Finding a good cognitive therapist can help you further but if that s not an option for you right now there are lots of selfhelp books and websites that are out there  You ve already taken the first step so keep moving forward '),\n",

       "  'I suggest that you work on emotional awareness  Emotional awareness basically means knowing what you are feeling and why Emotional awareness also means that you can identify the link between the way you are feeling and your actions  In other words knowing that your feelings dictate what you do Often feelings of hurt or insecurity can come out as anger if we cannot properly identify and express the feelings Being emotionally aware also means that you are able to express your feelings to others   Being unable to do so leads to feelings of frustration and being misunderstood Many people for many different reasons are not in touch with their emotions   For example men traditionally have been brought up taught to not express sadness or weakness   Therefore many men learned to turn feelings of sadness insecurities or fears into anger and express these feelings as anger   Being taught not to feel a certain emotion does not make that emotion disappear   Instead it makes us learn how to express it in other incorrect ways   If a man never learns to say  I am sad  or  that really hurt my feelings  and instead lashes out in anger then the response they get from those around them will be to the anger and not a response to the underlying true feeling which will leave the man feeling alone and misunderstood You can control yourself and not explode   Walk away remove yourself from the situation do whatever you have to do to not lash out   Instead of reacting the way you normally would go somewhere by yourself and think about what just happened and try to understand why such a  simple  thing upset you   What is the real feeling driving these outbursts   Maybe you can begin to recognize an underlying pattern  It might help to keep an anger journal   Write down everything that gets you upset   That might help you see a pattern and pinpoint what may be setting you off   Talking with a therapist about this would be beneficial in helping pinpoint the underlying cause of the outbursts you are experience  '),\n",

       "['<START> What you are describing is something psychologists have termed triangulation which is what happens when one family member will not talk to the one they have a problem with and goes to a third member of the family to complain instead You have been triangulated by your wife and mother This is often seen in families It s seen everywhere How many times have you had a problem with someone but you didn t go to them to tell them you went to someone else to complain It is usually difficult for a person to confront another especially in relationships where there is a power differential For example I bet it s easier to complain to a coworker about your boss rather than go to the boss with your complaint I m not saying triangulation is always a bad thing Sometimes a third party mediator is needed to help solve problems between two people who disagree That s what therapists do every day Sometimes just getting someone else s perspective can help you see the issue clearer However in your situation it sounds like this is becoming a problem You are stuck in the middle between two people that love you and that you love If you want to put a stop to this triangulation you will need to encourage the two of them to talk to each other and work out their differences Perhaps it was a simple misunderstanding that some open communication can clear up Even if they really don t like each other and can t get along your relationship with the both of them is going to continue to deteriorate the longer you are stuck in the middle Try to understand what might be the feelings behind their behavior It is possible that they may both feel threatened by the other These are the two most important women in your life and they both know it Your mother may be afraid that she will lose you if she confronts your wife I heard one motherinlaw describe her son s wife as the gateway to her son The wife has the power to dictate when and how often the mother gets to see her son The wife also is the gateway to the grandchildren If your wife doesn t like her motherinlaw she can severely hamper or damage her motherinlaw s relationship with you and any children you two may have From your wife s viewpoint this is the woman that she may feel like she can never live up to If you regularly praise your mom s cooking her housework gardening or anything else your wife may feel that you are putting down her own efforts in these areas and can feel unappreciated This can be especially difficult if your wife and mother are nothing alike I am not saying that this is the case with your family s situation These are just a few examples from other families in a similar situation as yours Regardless of what the cause is if this dysfunctional pattern is allowed to continue your mom and your wife will begin to get upset with you when you don t agree with them They will get upset if you don t align yourself with them against the other They will be offended when it seems like you are choosing the other one s side or that you are not standing up for them like they think you should In worst cases if it continues to escalate you may even find yourself in the impossible position of having to choose between your wife and your mother which may mean cutting off contact with the other ending that relationship Change the dynamics before it spirals even further <END>',\n",
       " '<START> Hi Good for you in planning ahead to do what s healthiest for your baby and yourself That s a great first step It s also good that you are able to identify that it s not always a physical need that s driving the addiction For the next steps I would suggest trying to figure out when the psychological cravings for a cigarette occur The psychological or mental cravings are usually based out of habit such as having a cigarette after a meal And if you re consciously trying to quit you ll find the craving starts with simply thinking about having a cigarette then usually moves on to thinking about how good it made you feel etc etc Well if I m on a diet and I continue to let myself think about the ice cream sitting in the freezer eventually I ll give in and eat it You re going to have thoughts about smoking a cigarette That s normal and for the most part out of your control But you choose whether or not to CONTINUE thinking and dwelling about it after that initial thought That s what you would have to work on changing When you have that initial thought acknowledge it Ok I kind of want a cigarette now but then change the thoughts that typically follow Distract yourself think about something else do something else whatever it takes to get your mind off of that cigarette I ve suggested to clients before that they should plan these scenarios out ahead of time so they already know what they re going to do when the time comes Write down when you usually have the craving for a cigarette and then write down new thoughts or things to do to get your mind off of it Eventually it will become easier and easier to brush off that initial thought until you no longer have it Best of luck and you have a really great motivator to quit your baby <END>',\n",
       " '<START> It sounds like keeping the secrets has become a problem for you now There are several things to consider before you make a decision You mentioned that you don t want your wife and mom to know because you don t want to hurt them why would it hurt them Is it necessary for them to know this information What are the consequences of either telling them the truth or not telling them for you and for your wife and mom Once you have considered these think of what you would tell your friend if they were in your exact situation Also if your wife or mom were in your situation right now what do you think they would do themselves If your wife and mom were in this situation how would you feel Would you want to know the secrets How has keeping these secrets affected your own mental and physical health Once you have looked at the problem from all angles you will be able to better make a decision on whether it is right to tell them or not <END>',\n",
       " '<START> Hi there It s great you are able to realize there are other issues going on with someone who feels possessive At the root of it is fear Fear of losing someone fear of being alone fear of not being good enough All those fears can lead to low selfesteem and feeling like you have to control other people so you don t lose them The thing is controlling other people only pushes them away Vicious circle right What I would suggest is some cognitive therapy to change those underlying ways of thinking You can start with this assignment Write down all the things you think about yourself positive and notsopositive Then rewrite those notsopositive things so they are positive For example thinking something like I m too pushy can be rewritten as I m assertive and I go after what I want It can be hard to do since we tend to get stuck in our negative ways of thinking about ourselves If you have someone you trust you can ask for their help as well since most likely they see you differently than you see yourself Finding a good cognitive therapist can help you further but if that s not an option for you right now there are lots of selfhelp books and websites that are out there You ve already taken the first step so keep moving forward <END>',\n",
       " '<START> You didn t say what or how many medications you ve tried Certain anxiety medications can make you feel nauseous but I haven t heard of any that cause mouth blisters so there may be some other underlying medical issue there I would definitely talk to your primary care physician and whoever has prescribed the medication as well as a neurologist if you ve suffered a severe head injury There are so many medications available for anxiety or insomnia or even depression that there may be others with lesser side effects But beyond that have you tried any other treatments such as deep breathing or meditation Meditation can be very effective but it takes practice and you don t have to sit crosslegged for hours chanting Ohm to meditate It s about focusing on your breath rather than all the thoughts that are racing through your head And when they do take your mind off your breath simply refocus and refocus and refocus Like I said it takes practice so don t give up You can find many sites offering different ways to meditate so look around and see what works best for you Like medication you just have to find the one that works best and that might take some experimentation I hope this helps and best of luck to you <END>',\n",
       " '<START> It is a good thing that you have recognized that you have been in some unhealthy relationships and that you are wanting to break this pattern You seem to have some good insight into the situation The type of behavior that you are describing is usually rooted in childhood issues with insecure attachment bonds with your caregivers childhood trauma andor abuse or neglect or dysfunctional family issues that did not allow you to develop healthy boundaries for yourself or a sense of self This is something that is going to take some time to work through in therapy I recommend a book titled Boundaries Where you end and I begin by Anne Katherine Another book that might be helpful is Codependent No More by Melody Beattie In the meantime until you can work through your personal issues absolutely do not enter into another relationship Take however long you need to and work on becoming a whole happy emotionally healthy person on your own Needing another person to define you is problematic That s too much to expect from any individual For a relationship to be healthy and happy both people in the relationship first need to be a whole person on their own That means having a clear sense of self knowing who you are and what you want knowing how to set healthy boundaries and knowing how to meet your own needs It is unreasonable to expect your partner to meet all of your needs all of the time There will be times that they won t be able to meet your needs You have to know how to meet those yourself When you are working on becoming the best you that you can be eventually the right person will come into your life Then you can CHOOSE to be with someone because you want them in your life instead of feeling like you NEED them to complete you <END>',\n",
       " '<START> I suggest that you work on emotional awareness Emotional awareness basically means knowing what you are feeling and why Emotional awareness also means that you can identify the link between the way you are feeling and your actions In other words knowing that your feelings dictate what you do Often feelings of hurt or insecurity can come out as anger if we cannot properly identify and express the feelings Being emotionally aware also means that you are able to express your feelings to others Being unable to do so leads to feelings of frustration and being misunderstood Many people for many different reasons are not in touch with their emotions For example men traditionally have been brought up taught to not express sadness or weakness Therefore many men learned to turn feelings of sadness insecurities or fears into anger and express these feelings as anger Being taught not to feel a certain emotion does not make that emotion disappear Instead it makes us learn how to express it in other incorrect ways If a man never learns to say I am sad or that really hurt my feelings and instead lashes out in anger then the response they get from those around them will be to the anger and not a response to the underlying true feeling which will leave the man feeling alone and misunderstood You can control yourself and not explode Walk away remove yourself from the situation do whatever you have to do to not lash out Instead of reacting the way you normally would go somewhere by yourself and think about what just happened and try to understand why such a simple thing upset you What is the real feeling driving these outbursts Maybe you can begin to recognize an underlying pattern It might help to keep an anger journal Write down everything that gets you upset That might help you see a pattern and pinpoint what may be setting you off Talking with a therapist about this would be beneficial in helping pinpoint the underlying cause of the outbursts you are experience <END>',\n",
       " '<START> First of all exercise is always beneficial for your physical and emotional health That s great that you have added this in your routine Have you also considered altering your diet Certain foods are linked with poor sleep For example alcohol caffeine nicotine and high fat content foods do not bode well with quality sleep especially right before bed time On the other hand warm milk and foods high in carbohydrates have actually shown to positively impact sleep Additionally at bed time it s important to keep your room dim cool and without distractions i e TV IPad Phone Stick to a sleep routine and avoid any activities close to bed time that demand a lot of attention and energy As far as your nightmares there could be many causes contributing to them Certain foods many of the ones mentioned or medications could be the culprit Doing a bit of research into the ones you are consuming may help you eliminate the offender You may also benefit from talk therapy with a qualified therapist to discuss any underlying issues you are experiencing Oftentimes depression and anxiety can manifest themselves during sleep causing nightmares Finally Yoga has shown to be very beneficial for quality sleep There are many instructional videos available that can introduce you to the practice if you d rather not join a class right away Best of luck to you and I sincerely hope you are able to catch up on some well deserved Z s <END>',\n",
       " '<START> I will admit I am confused about this question Are you the other parent in question or a concerned coworker of this therapist Therapists do not prescribe or have access to medication Most therapists won t even get involved in a custody battle They know there is a good chance of their records ending up in court and that they themselves will have to testify in court Of course therapists are human and can make mistakes but I find it highly unlikely that a therapist would knowingly and willingly do something like this that is such a major ethical violation Not only are they losing their license to practice by doing this they are going to face criminal charges and jail time If their clinical judgment is that the other parent is a danger to the child they don t have to resort to illegal means to try to prove this If you have concrete proof that this has happened then there is a process in which you can file a report against the therapist with their licensure board Every therapist is licensed in their state There are different types of licensures so you would need to know this therapist s licensure Most accusations from the other parent are expected in a custody situation because people do tend to get quite ugly Don t accuse the therapist or the parent of anything just to try to make yourself look better and them look bad Have evidence of wrongdoing before accusing them of this If this has really happened then of course it needs to be reported but don t try to ruin someone s career unless you are sure this occurred <END>',\n",
       " '<START> It sounds like your confused as to why your friends would be calling you a hypocrite when they act in the same manner correct Communication is key to any relationship I would recommend speaking with your friends facetoface to address why they feel your behavior is concerning Inperson contact is the best method of sorting out differences considering texts emails or any written response can be misconstrued Be upfront with them and let them know that being accused of hypocrisy is hurtful and you feel it is unfounded If after speaking with them you feel that they have valid reasons for the way they are feeling maybe you can consider modifying your behavior accordingly Especially if this friendship is valuable to you However make sure they are aware that there is a respectful way to address these issues and name calling is not one of them On the other hand if you feel that their reasons are indeed unfounded it may be best to distance yourself from the relationship Not all friendships are healthy ones And it is important that you surround yourself with people who are an asset to your self esteem as opposed to those that hinder it I hope you are able to get this matter sorted Best of luck <END>',\n",

       " '<START> Hi there Being years old can be a very difficult time in your teenage life I remember when I was and how I often felt my parents weren t listening to me It s even more difficult when you feel that you do not have a friend that you can confide in Having depression in the past and being able to get through it shows me that you can get through anything Depression alone is a very difficult problem to work through In addition to the communication problem with your parents it appears that you are also struggling with stress and anxiety We all have stress and anxiety in our lives If we didn t none of us would be living Anxiety amp stress keep us on our toes Often I have to remind myself of this as well However it is how we manage stress and anxiety so it will not overcome our lives Are you familiar with relaxation techniques such as deep breathing exercises meditation or yoga Relaxation Techniques can help you tremendously in reducing your stress and anxiety Deep breathing exercises are helpful when you are on the go such as school shopping out with friends or whatever extracurricular activities you engage in Most people do not take full advantage of their lung capacity I know that sounds silly But it s true You would be surprised how much air you lungs can hold Imagine being in the Doctor s office and taking deep breaths This is what you want to do when you are feeling overwhelmed andor stressed Take a moment to take in at least deep breaths and let them out slowly You will be surprised how well you feel afterwards Meditation and Yoga are also healthy forms to working through stress and anxiety You will need a quiet place for your meditation You want to be in the moment and take in the peace and serenity All it takes is a quiet place closing your eyes and thinking of your happy place Some people use meditation music as well If you have access to this type of music and or the internet for more ways to practice meditation please go for it Yoga on the other hand will take a little more work and practice I would not suggest you learning this on your own if you have never attempted yoga before Find an experienced Yoga instructor to teach you the ropes andor ask your school counselor about the possibility of getting someone to come to the school to teach the students Lastly in regards to your parents it is very important to be able to have a relationship where you feel comfortable communicating I would recommend writing a letter to them if you are unable to express how you feel in person A letter is more intimate and requires a little more effort on their end If they are open on working on this relationship maybe suggest family counseling to fully work on this issue I hope this was helpful for you and I wish you the best <END>',\n",
       " '<START> I don t think you ve lost something I think you ve found something your breaking point and it s about time Your boyfriend seems to be a very selfish and immature man who reconnects with you when it s convenient for him Obviously he has his own issues but I want to address yours I agree you need to talk to someone The fact that you ve put up with his repeated cheating and then letting him blame you for it by saying you re not affectionate enough etc tells me you probably have low selfesteem and have likely told yourself over the years that you don t deserve any better You do You may truly love this guy but based on his behaviors he does not love you not in the way you deserve And although you may want to believe he can change he has proved over and over again that he s not willing to so you need to do what is best for you and your children What would you tell your daughters if someone was treating them this way Would you want your sons to treat women this way That s what you re teaching your children when they see this Like I said I agree that you should talk to someone You can ask your boyfriend to go too but my guess is he won t Even if he does you should still see someone individually to work on YOU I understand it s not easy to just kick him out especially since you have children together but a counselor can help you talk through all the details while helping you raise your selfesteem and selfworth <END>']"
